		<body>
		<br><font size="5">Congratulations for getting a pet! You are starting a fantastic and fulfilling relationship. We've created a checklist to help ensure a seamless transition because adopting a new pet involves many changes for both the pet and the pet parent.</font></br>
		<h3>
		  <br><strong><font size="5">Be Patient</font></br></strong>
		</h3>
		<br>
			<p>-Anybody, even your dog, may find it difficult to move into a new house and socialize with strangers. It's crucial to give your dog enough time to become used to all the new experiences they will have, such as meeting new people and animals. Positive, not forced, exposure to these new environments is what's intended.</p>
		</br>
			<h3>
			  <b><strong><font size="5">Establish a Routine</font></b></strong>
			</h3>
		<br>
			<p>-Introducing your new dog to your resident dog should be a deliberate, step-by-step process, not a one-time event. Be mindful of the dogs’ safety during the interactions, their histories with other animals, their personalities, and their body language. This information can help guide your approach and show whether adjustments are needed. In general, consider the following do's and don’ts:</p>
			<p>Do's</p>
			<li>Make use of encouraging feedback</li>
			<li>End interactions when either dog exhibits fear or hostility, and resume when they are both calm.</li>
			<li>Start the conversation in a neutral setting by going for a stroll together.</li>
			<li>Take into account the intervals between conversations.</li>
			<p>Don'ts:</p>
			<li>Press for conversation.</li>
			<li>During the initial encounters, scatter the resident dog's toys about the house.</li>
			<li>Ignore warning indications of a bad encounter and carry on with the conversation</li>
		</br>
			<h3>
				  <b><font size="5">Establish Crate Training as Soon as Possible</font></b>
			</h3>
		<br>
				<p>-There are a lot of advantages to crate training your dog, including simpler housebreaking and safety while traveling or left alone. Crate training should be started as soon as possible to ensure that it becomes a regular part of their routine. The container ought to be a cozy and secure space. See your veterinarian for assistance if, while crate training, your new dog exhibits signs of anxiety or terror.</p>
		</br>	
			<h3>
				  <b><font size="5">Provide Necessary Enrichment</font></b>
			</h3>
			<br>
				<p>-An integral component of animal welfare and health is environmental enrichment. This includes activities, games, and bedding that are suitable and improve your dog's comfort level in your house. To safeguard your dog's safety when playing with new toys, keep an eye on them. There are lots of toys out there; the ideal ones are sturdy pieces that won't shatter teeth, get trapped in the mouth, or be swallowed.</p>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b><font size="5">Find a Trainer for Positive-Enrichment Dogs</font></b>
			</h3>
			<br>
				<p>-Beyond simply showing a dog to obey, dog training can also enhance general behavior, boost your dog's confidence, provide mental and physical stimulation, and strengthen the human-animal link. Aggressive or unpleasant training techniques should be avoided as they can worsen animal welfare and encourage more troublesome behavior. Select a trainer or training session carefully; before deciding on one, think about speaking with the trainer or observing a session.</p>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b><font size="5">Potty Training with Encouragement</font></b>
			</h3>
			<br>
				<p>-When brought into a new setting, even housebroken dogs may first have accidents. House-training can generally be facilitated by the use of consistent orders like "go potty" and positive reward. It is advised to closely supervise your dog while they are not confined, go outdoors frequently, interrupt accidents rather than punish them, and give your dog a treat right away when they go potty outside.</p>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b><font size="5">Make a Diet or Food Change</font></b>
			</h3>
			<br>
				<p>-Dogs can choose from a wide variety of commercial diets, but for good growth, they need a complete and balanced diet. If the diet your new dog is on is working well for him, it might be wise to stick with it until you can talk to your veterinarian about other options for food. It's crucial to transition your pet's diet gradually over a period of one to two weeks if a new one is required or advised. The likelihood of diarrhea or upset stomach will decrease with a gradual shift.</p>
			</br>
			<h3>
				<b><font size="5">Exercise, Both Mental and Physical, Is Essential</font></b>
			</h3>
			<br>
				<p>-Like with people, mental and physical activity are essential for a happy, healthy dog. In addition to being a great kind of physical exercise, walking your dog stimulates your mind. Certain toys, like puzzle toys, are made to provide mental stimulation for your dog even when they're indoors. See your vet about recommended activity for your dog as it may vary depending on breed, age, and other factors.</p>
